            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p>I started working as a Youth Library Aid at the Garden City Public Library in 2014. My duties included helping to plan programs, assissting with linking and whatever tasks the Youth Librarian needed done. I held this position for three years.</p>
            <p> In 2017, the Youth Librarian I worked under got hired in at another library and I was offered the position. I was hesitent at first because I didn't have the degree qualifications but I was confident in everything I had learned as an aid to take the job.</p>
            <p> As part of my promotion, I had to begin working toward a Masters in Library Science. I was accepted into the online program at Wayne State where I dilligently took a single class every semester. I will be graduating in the Summer of 2022.</p>
            <p></p></div>

            <h2>What's The Job Like?</h2>
            <p>Being a Youth Librarian is a lot of fun. I get to basically hang out with kids all day. It's also my responsibility to order books, maintain the current collection and to help with readers advisory. I also run programing for ages 0-18, including Summer Reading events.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Special Projects</h2>
            <p>What's nice about my job is that I have a lot of freedom to take on speical projects that include fun things for patrons to check out that aren't just books. With the help of a grant, my library offers Science Kits and Reading Booster Packs and I parterned with our local Kiwanis to create Storytime to Go Kits.

            <h3>Science Kits</h3>
            <p>With a grant from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, we were able to create 12 science kits that patrons could take home to complete. These kits included circuitry, building with Legos, and two sets of math kits, one that focued on addition and subtraction and another on multiplication and division. These kits encourged children to explore Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics with fun activities at home. They have been very popular.</p>

            <h3>Reading Booster Packs</h3>
            <p>This project was also made possible by a grant from the Library of Michigan. These kits were created in order to help students grades K-3 struggling with their reading skills in order to help fullfill the Read by Grade Three Law in Michigan, where third grade students not reading at a third grade level could be help back. There are twenty kits total and each one focuses on a different element of reading: Fluency, Vocabulary, Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, and Comprehension and there is a kit for each grade level. For example, there's a kit that is Kindergarten level Comprehension, First Grade Level, and so one. These kits include books, activities and games to help the student practice and focus on each skill. These have been especially popular with parents who hope to help their child improve their skill.</p>

            <h3>Storytime To Go Kits</h3>
            <p>When my local Kiwanis reached out to ask for a program aimed at children ages 0-5, I knew I wanted to create take home storytime kits. When COVID hit, my library closed and I did storytime exclusively online which was fun but missed that fun, interactive element. These Storytime To Go Kits include five books, an activity and an interactive element, as well as an instruction guide to talk caregivers through the best way to ultalize the kit. Each kit has a theme and I've done Seasons, Dinosaurs, Colors and much more. These have been extremely popular with the kids, especially the interactive element. </p>
